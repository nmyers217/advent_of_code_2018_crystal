# Advent of Code 2018 Crystal

This is just some of my solutions to [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) in the [Crystal Programming Language](https://crystal-lang.org/).

I like to pick a new language each year for AOC, and for 2019 I am considering Crystal because I really enjoy Ruby, especially when its **not slow**.

Two issues still have me on the fence:
1. Semi-poor IDE support (this really isn't a showstopper for me at all)
2. Very poor debugging story (GDB is cool and all, but not if I can't easily drill into the data structures)

If I do bail on crystal, I'll just end up falling back to ECMAscript.

This repo is just to research/practice the language so that I will have a head start when December arrives, so I am not intending to finish all the questions for 2018 (see my [Nim answers for 2018](https://github.com/nmyers217/advent_of_code_2018_nim) if you want a more complete selection of answers).


## Installation

You will need to have the [Crystal compiler](https://crystal-lang.org/install/) installed on your machine.


## Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Cd into the project directory
```sh
crystal run src/aoc.cr
```
